INRC 2010 evaluator
===================

Evaluator for the INRC2010 benchmark [Haspeslagh et al 2014]. This benchmark has been proposed for the first International
Nurse Rostering Competition held in 2010. The evaluator is based on the model given in [Lü and Hao 2012] and used in 
[Meignan et al. 2015], [Meignan 2014] and  [Meignan 2015].
